1. Copy the ExtensionExample.plist in this folder to your tweak's prefs, inside the same folder as your Root.plist
2. Modify the values inside it to match your tweak.
3. Rename it to "HomePlus.plist"

TODO:

* Require far less stuff to be specified in the Plist
* Handle tweaks that do really weird stuff for prefs
