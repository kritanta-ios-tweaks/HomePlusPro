Viva is a modern, free, open source continuation of the old iOS 14 tweak "HomePlus Pro", by the original author.

Tested on devices on iOS 13.0-16.3.

It provides the common bells and whistles of a modern layout editor, in an intuitive and precise UI.

Pinch the homescreen to edit your layout.

~ This is an after-work project, and I can't really predict how much time I'll have to work on it, but I have a lot of features planned, and a roadmap forward for adding them, stay tuned. 

### Known Issues

There's noticable lag on setting the scale of icons currently. 
This is because Viva uses a more robust method of scaling them that requires rebuilding the images when edited, but avoids any visual bugs or performance overhead later.
