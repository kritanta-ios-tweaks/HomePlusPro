# Viva

Viva is a modern, free, open source continuation of the old iOS 14 tweak "HomePlus Pro"

### Get this tweak

Repo: 

### Build

Install dragon: https://dragon.cynder.me/en/latest/setup.html

`dragon s` -> setup your device's IP

`dragon build release install` -> Build the project for release, then install it.

### Contributing/Hacking on

Building without the `release`/`r` flag will redirect all `NSLog`s to an overlay view you can show/hide by tapping on its borders.




### why the rename?

It was too similar to LockPlus. Also it's been a couple of years.
